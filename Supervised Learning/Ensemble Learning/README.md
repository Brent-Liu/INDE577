# Ensemble Learning

This folder contains the implementation of Ensemble Learning models.

## File Description

In 'Ensemble Learning Methods.ipynb' file, I first introduced the concept of ensemble learning models. Then I illustrated the Bagging, Random Forests, Adaboost and Gradient Boosing separately.I implemented the Bagging, Random Forests and Adaboost model on the palm penguins dataset, and applied the gradient boosting regressor model on the function with one variable.

## Dataset used in applications

As to the dataset, we will use the palmer penguins data, which contains different body measurements for three species of penguins from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The palmer_penguins dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. It has 7 features in total, where 3 features can be used as label, which is species, island and sex. The rest four features are bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length and body_mass, the body measurements of individual penguins.

In this project, we will apply the Bagging, Random Forests, Adaboost algorithms in the palmer penguins data and compare the performance between the models.
