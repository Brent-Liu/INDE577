## Dataset used in applications

As to the dataset, we will use the palmer penguins data, which contains different body measurements for three species of penguins from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The palmer_penguins dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. It has 7 features in total, where 3 features can be used as label, which is species, island and sex. The rest four features are bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length and body_mass, the body measurements of individual penguins.

In this project, we will apply the logistic algorithms in the palmer penguins data, aiming to judge the sex of penguins based on the penguins' body mass, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, species and island they leave. The sex, flipper_length, body_mass, biil_depth, bill_length, island and species features will be used in this project.
