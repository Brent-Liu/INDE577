# Multilayer Perceptron

This folder contains the theoretical introduction and coding implementation of Multilayer Perceptron model.

## File Description

In 'Multilayer_Perceptron.ipynb' file, I first introduced the concept of multilayer perceptron model. Then I illustrated the model algorithm. Next, I applied the multilayer perceptron model on the palmer penguins dataset. Finally, I will introduce a tool, tensorflow, to build multilayer quickly and apply the tensorflow to our penguins dataset.

## Dataset used in applications

As to the dataset, we will use the palmer penguins data, which contains different body measurements for three species of penguins from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The palmer_penguins dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. It has 7 features in total, where 3 features can be used as label, which is species, island and sex. The rest four features are bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length and body_mass, the body measurements of individual penguins.

In this project, we will apply the Multilayer_Perceptron algorithms in the palmer penguins data, aiming to judge the sex of penguins based on the rest features of the dataset. Then, we will rewind this process with the help of tensorflow. We will compare the performance of the Multilayer perceptron model we build and the model ran by tensorflow for the same task.
