# K-Nearest Neighbors

This repository represents the implementation and applications of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## File descriptions

"K-Nearest Neighbors.ipynb" contains the describtion and my hard coding of KNN algorithm, then it's applied on a classification and a regression problem. Further the affect of _k_ is explored on a dataset.

Outline:

- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Code of KNN classifier and regressor
- Choose of K
- Applications on data sets
  - Classification problem
  - Regression problem

## Dataset used in applications

As to the dataset, we will use the palmer penguins data, which contains different body measurements for three species of penguins from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The palmer_penguins dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. It has 7 features in total, where 3 features can be used as label, which is species, island and sex. The rest four features are bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length and body_mass, the body measurements of individual penguins.

In this project, we want to use KNN algorithms to distinguish the three penguin species, Adelie,Chinstrap, and Gentoo by bill length and bill depth. Species, bill_length and bill_depth features will be used in this project.
