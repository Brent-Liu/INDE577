# Linear Regreesion

This repository represents the theoretical knowledge, implementation and applications of Linear Regression (LR).

## File descriptions

"Linear_Regression.ipynb" contains the the theoretical introduction of linear regression, the algorithms and its implementation with python code, and the application of the linear regression algorithm to the palmer penguins dataset.

Outline:

- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Code of linear regression
- Applications on data sets

## Dataset used in applications

As to the dataset, we will use the palmer penguins data, which contains different body measurements for three species of penguins from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The palmer_penguins dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. It has 7 features in total, where 3 features can be used as label, which is species, island and sex. The rest four features are bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length and body_mass, the body measurements of individual penguins.

In this project, we will apply the Perceptron algorithms in the palmer penguins data, aiming to find the linear relationship between flipper length and body mass. The flipper_length and body_mass features will be used in this project.
