# Gradient Descent

This folder contains the implementation of Gradient Descent algorithm.

## File Description

In 'Gradient_Descent' file, I first briefly introduced the gradient descent algorithm. Then applied the gradient descent algorithm to find the local minimum of functions of several variable and functions of several variables.

Outline:

- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Coding
- Conclusion
