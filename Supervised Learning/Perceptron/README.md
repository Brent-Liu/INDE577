# Perceptron

This repository will cover the basic theory and implementation of Perceptron Algorithms, which is shown in the ipynb file.

## File descriptions

"The_Perceptron.ipynb" contains the briefly theoretical illustration and implementation of perceptron algorithm with python.

Outline:

- Introduction
- Theoretical illustration
- Code of Perceptron
- Applications on data sets

## Dataset used in applications

As to the dataset, we will use the palmer penguins data, which contains different body measurements for three species of penguins from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The palmer_penguins dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. It has 7 features in total, where 3 features can be used as label, which is species, island and sex. The rest four features are bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length and body_mass, the body measurements of individual penguins.

In this project, we will apply the Perceptron algorithms in the palmer penguins data, aiming to judge the sex of penguins based on the flipper length and body mass. the sex, flipper_length and body_mass features will be used in this project.
