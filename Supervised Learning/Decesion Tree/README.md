# Decision Tree

This folder contains the theoratical introduction and coding implementation of Decision Trees Model.

## File Description

In 'Decision Tree.ipynb' file, I first introduced the concept of decision trees. Then I illustrated the model algorithm. At last, I applied the decision trees classifier model and decision trees regressor model on the palm panguins dataset.

Outline:

- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Decision Tree Classifier Implementation
- Decision Tree Regressor Implementation

## Dataset used in applications

As to the dataset, we will use the palmer penguins data, which contains different body measurements for three species of penguins from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The palmer_penguins dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. It has 7 features in total, where 3 features can be used as label, which is species, island and sex. The rest four features are bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length and body_mass, the body measurements of individual penguins.

In this project, we will first apply the Decision Tree classifier algorithms in the palmer penguins data, aiming to judge the sex of penguins based on the flipper length and body mass. The sex, flipper_length and body_mass features will be used. Then, we will apply the Decision Tree regressor algorithms in the palmer penguins data, aiming to use the bill depth, bill length and flipper length to predict the body mass. The flipper_length, body_mass, bill_depth, bill_length features will be used.
