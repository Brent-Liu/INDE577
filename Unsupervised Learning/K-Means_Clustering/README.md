# K-Means Clustering

This folder contains the introduction and implementation of K-Means Clustering method.

## File Description

In 'K-Means Clustering.ipynb' file, I first introduced the concept of the K-Means. Then I illustrated the algorithm. At last, I will apply the K-Means clustering method into palm penguins dataset.

Outline:

- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Coding

## Dataset used in applications

As to the dataset, we will use the palmer penguins data, which contains different body measurements for three species of penguins from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The palmer_penguins dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. It has 7 features in total, where 3 features can be used as label, which is species, island and sex. The rest four features are bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length and body_mass, the body measurements of individual penguins.

In this project, we will apply the K-Means algorithms in the palmer penguins data. The penguins has three species, we want to know if K-Means algorithms can distinguish the three species based on bill length and bill depth features.
