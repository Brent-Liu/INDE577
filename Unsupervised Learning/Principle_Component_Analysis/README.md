# Principle Component Analysis

This folder contains the theory and implementation of Principle Component Analysis method.

## File Description

In 'Principal Component Analysis.ipynb' file, I first introduced the concept of the PCA. Then I briefly illustrated the algorithm. At last, I applied the PCA on the palmer penguins dataset.

Outline:

- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Coding

As to the dataset, we will use the palmer penguins data, which contains different body measurements for three species of penguins from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The palmer_penguins dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. It has 7 features in total, where 3 features can be used as label, which is species, island and sex. The rest four features are bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length and body_mass, the body measurements of individual penguins.

In this project, we will apply the PCA algorithms in the palmer penguins data. We want to find the first principle component and second component of penguins species data. And we will visualize the component in the graph.
