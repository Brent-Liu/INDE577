# Rice INDE 577 - Data Science and Machine Learning

Creator: Chenning Liu

## Course Description

This repository contains the code and documentations for the project of INDE 577, Data Science and Machine Learning, at Rice University in Fall 2022. In the course, we learned machine learning algorithms by using python language. Course topics consist of supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning methods.
